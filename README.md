## 📌 Features

* Classic Wordle gameplay (color-coded feedback)
* Custom word lists (great for classes or themed games)
* Simple and lightweight implementation
* Easy to modify and extend

---

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Enter a valid word guess.
2. After each guess, you'll receive feedback:

   * 🟩 **Green**: Correct letter in the correct position
   * 🟨 **Yellow**: Correct letter in the wrong position
   * ⬜ **Gray**: Letter is not in the word
3. Use the clues to guess the correct word within the allowed number of tries.

Wordle-style games rely on iterative guessing and feedback to narrow down possibilities.

## 🧠 How It Works

The game compares each guess to the target word and assigns feedback based on:

* Correct letter + correct position → green
* Correct letter + wrong position → yellow
* Not in word → gray

This logic is similar to Mastermind-style deduction games.
